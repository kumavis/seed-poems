# seed-poems

A quick experiment in generating seed phrases that appear (a bit) more like sentences than random jumbles of words. The hope is that this format is easier to memorize, however the results are not excellent. Perhaps this could be improved with better curated word lists, using adjectives, etc.

These word lists used are different from [bip-39](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) and therefore are not compatible.

### disclaimer

dont use this for anything other than experiments
